# Database Migrations (Alembic)

This directory contains the database migration scripts managed by Alembic. 

## Strategy
We use an asynchronous migration strategy with `SQLAlchemy` and `asyncpg`. Migrations are used to manage schema changes for:
- Core invoice and extraction tables
- `pgvector` index metadata
- `pgqueuer` background job schema

## Usage
To apply migrations:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

To create a new migration:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```
